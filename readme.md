# Stems Machine

## How to use it:

Replace the link below named ytLink with the link to the video you wish to get stems from.

then, either type **ctrl + f9** or go up and hit the "**Run All**" option in the runtime menu. 

Give it a few minutes to download and install [**Spleeter**](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter), and then it should usually take between one and two minutes for a typical song to be converted.

Once it's done running, to get stems for another song, simply replace the ytLink value below and either hit **ctrl + f9** or go up and hit the "**Run All**" option in the runtime menu again. 

## Caveats 

After the process had finished, you will be prompted to download the file. If you've already downloaded one file and are getting a second set of stems, your browser may pop up a warning about downloading multiple files from google collab. You can hit accept to keep downloading more. Or you don't have to-- totally up to you lol!

## What you get

A zipped folder with stems that include: \
-- **Vocals.mp3** \
-- **Piano.mp3** \
-- **Bass.mp3** \
-- **Drums.mp3** \
-- **Other.mp3**
